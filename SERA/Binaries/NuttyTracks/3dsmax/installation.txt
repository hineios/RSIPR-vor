Create a new environment variable called NUTTYTHALAMUSPATH and set it to the NuttyThalamusenviron folder
(example: D:\Projects\NuttyWorks\NuttyThalamus)
If you have 3dsmax open, close it so it will use the new environment variable.

Open 3dsmax.

Drag the file NuttyThalamus.mcr to 3dsmax.
Nothing will happen, that is OK.


Go to menu "Customize"... and to "Customize User Interface"
Go to tab "Toolbars"
In the dropdown "Category:" select "Nutty"

Drag NuttyThalamus to any toolbar.
The recommended place is somewhere on the top next to the box called "Create Selection Set"
